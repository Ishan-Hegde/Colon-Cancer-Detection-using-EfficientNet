Introduction

Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This project uses EfficientNet, a highly efficient and scalable deep learning model, to analyze colon images and classify them as cancerous or non-cancerous, aiming to aid in the diagnosis and early detection of colon cancer.
Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of colonoscopy images annotated for colon cancer detection.
Data Sources

    Kaggle Colon Cancer Dataset
    [Other Medical Imaging Sources]

    Note: Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to use the dataset and adhere to data privacy and ethical guidelines.

Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required libraries.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Colon-Cancer-Detection-using-EfficientNet.git
cd Colon-Cancer-Detection-using-EfficientNet
pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch (depending on implementation)
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    OpenCV (optional, for image processing)

Model Architecture

This project uses the EfficientNet model, specifically a variant such as EfficientNet-B0 or EfficientNet-B4, based on the balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency.

EfficientNet scales the network's depth, width, and resolution uniformly using a compound scaling method, which allows us to achieve high accuracy with fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art architectures.
Training

To train the model, ensure the dataset is preprocessed and organized. Run the training script:

python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

Parameters:

    --dataset_path: Path to the training dataset
    --epochs: Number of training epochs
    --batch_size: Batch size for training

Training Configuration

    Optimizer: Adam
    Learning Rate: 0.001
    Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy
    Metrics: Accuracy, AUC

Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation/testing set:

python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --dataset_path /path/to/test_dataset

Evaluation Metrics

    Accuracy
    AUC (Area Under the Curve)
    Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Results
Metric	Value
Accuracy	XX%
AUC	XX
Precision	XX%
Recall	XX%
F1 Score	XX%
Usage

To classify new images:

python predict.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --image_path /path/to/image.jpg

This command will output whether the image is classified as cancerous or non-cancerous.
